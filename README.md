## Technologies Used
RealEstateMERN is built using the following technologies:

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing the application's data, including user information, property listings, and chat messages.
- Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework used for handling the back-end API routes and middleware.
- React: A JavaScript library for building the user interface, including the user and realtor dashboards, property browsing, and live chat components.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for executing the server-side code.
- Socket.io: A real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication library used for implementing the live chat feature between users and realtors.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object, used for user and realtor authentication and authorization.
- React Router: A collection of navigational components for managing routing in the React application.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the front-end to the back-end.
- Bootstrap: A popular CSS framework used for styling the user interface and ensuring responsiveness across different devices.
